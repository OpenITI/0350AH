90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro edition cannot be found because there
    is no data in the METADATA section to show which edition it is. Although
    the edition I have used here for collation is different, it is very
    similar to the text and I didn’t see major changes. 2- A missing title
    in page 35 (= page 130 in PDF).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
