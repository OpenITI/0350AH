90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The Editpro edition cannot be found because there
    is no data in the METADATA section to show which edition it is. Although
    the edition I have used here for collation is different, it is very
    similar to the text and I didn’t see major changes. 2- This short
    treatise has no title and nothing else that need to be tagged.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
