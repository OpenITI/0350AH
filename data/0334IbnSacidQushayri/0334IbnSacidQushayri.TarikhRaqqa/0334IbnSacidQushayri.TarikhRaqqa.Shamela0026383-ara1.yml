90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The text consists of three sections, but these
    sections have no effect on the structure of the book; so, I didn’t tag
    the beginning of the sections. However, there is an editorial section at
    the beginning of each section. 2- All editorial sections (except the
    first one) are the notes of the scribe.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
