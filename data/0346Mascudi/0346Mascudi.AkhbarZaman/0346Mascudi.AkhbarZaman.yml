90#BOOK#COMMENT##: According to al-Masʿūdī's introduction to his Murūj al-dhahab,
    Akhbār al-Zamān was his earliest book on history and geography.
    Michael Cooperson (https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/masudi)
    states that "A work under this title has been published, 
    but it is far too abbreviated and far too divergent in style 
    from the Moruj and the Tanbih to be considered authentic. 
    Its author may nevertheless have had access to now-lost works by Masʿudi."
