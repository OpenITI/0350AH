90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The work seems not to have come to us in its original form
    (which Ibn al-Qifṭī cites as Kitāb al-Masālik wa-al-mamālik bi-al-Yaman, 
    and Ḥajjī Khalīfa as al-Mamālik wa-al-masālik fī ʿajā'ib al-Yaman wa-Jazīrat al-ʿarab wa-asmā' bilādihā).
    The work now extant under the title Ṣifat Jazīrat al-ʿArab is supposedly only
    a partial version of the work (see Sezgin, GAS 14.198f.).
    It consists of three parts (see GAS 14.199-202):
    (1) the Arabian peninsula in the 7 climes and mathematical geography
    (2) geographical description of the Arabian peninsula
    (3) poetry about places in the Arabian peninsula
